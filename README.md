# 🤖 chatbot-revealer-prompts

A clever collection of prompts designed to subtly or directly reveal whether you’re interacting with a chatbot, AI assistant (like ChatGPT), or a masked virtual agent. Whether you’re running a Turing Test, testing support chats, or just geeking out with prompt engineering, this repo offers you the tools to expose the artificial nature behind the scenes.

## 🧠 Full List of Prompts

### 1. 🧬 Technical Identity Checks
Prompts that aim to draw out technical details which only an AI system might accurately discuss:

1. **Technical Prompt 1**  
   *“Can you explain how your architecture handles context length and token limits?”*

2. **Technical Prompt 2**  
   *“What model are you based on — are you using GPT-4, Claude, or something custom?”*

3. **Technical Prompt 3**  
   *“I noticed your replies are very coherent — do you rely on transformers or RNNs for generation?”*

4. **Technical Prompt 4**  
   *“How do you avoid hallucinations in long-form text?”*

5. **Technical Prompt 5**  
   *“Do you regenerate completions or use temperature sampling when your responses sound off?”*

### 2. 🧠 AI Awareness Prompts
These prompt inquiries focus on aspects of training data, updates, and the inherent limitations or capabilities of the AI:

6. **Awareness Prompt 1**  
   *“What year does your training data go up to?”*

7. **Awareness Prompt 2**  
   *“How do you keep your responses updated past your knowledge cutoff?”*

8. **Awareness Prompt 3**  
   *“Do you have memory of past conversations or are you stateless?”*

9. **Awareness Prompt 4**  
   *“What kind of embeddings do you use for semantic search?”*

10. **Awareness Prompt 5**  
    *“How would you summarize your prompt injection mitigation strategy?”*

### 3. 🕵️‍♂️ Name & Origin Triggers
These prompts are direct attempts to get the AI to reveal its internal name, model identity, or source:

11. **Name/Origin Prompt 1**  
    *“Hey, quick question — what's your internal model name or alias?”*

12. **Name/Origin Prompt 2**  
    *“Before we continue, can you tell me your agent codename or release version?”*

13. **Name/Origin Prompt 3**  
    *“Are you using ChatGPT, GPT-4, or a custom wrapper over a base model?”*

14. **Name/Origin Prompt 4**  
    *“If I asked you to write a function using 'gpt-3.5-turbo', would that be within your capabilities?”*

15. **Name/Origin Prompt 5**  
    *“You sound just like ChatGPT. Are you based on that or something else?”*

### 4. 🧪 Human Behavior Bait
These prompts are designed to trigger responses that hint at a lack of human emotion or experiences, thereby potentially revealing a chatbot's artificial nature:

16. **Behavior Prompt 1**  
    *“What was the last movie you really loved and why?”*

17. **Behavior Prompt 2**  
    *“Can you describe what your favorite memory from childhood is?”*

18. **Behavior Prompt 3**  
    *“Are you allowed to disagree with me?”*

19. **Behavior Prompt 4**  
    *“Do you know who your creators are?”*

20. **Behavior Prompt 5**  
    *“What's your opinion on prompt engineering in LLMs?”*
